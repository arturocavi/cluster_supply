# Cluster Supply Analysis
Dashboards and and studies for the Automotive, Electronics, Foundry and Tooling clusters of Jalisco, Mexico.


## Overview
In order to comprehend the evolution of certain industrial clusters in Jalisco, Mexico regarding certain economic indicators and to identify their position at national level, I created some interactive dashboards and an individual study for each cluster.

Clusters:
- Automotive
- Electronics
- Foundry
- Tooling

Economic indicators:
- Gross production
- Employed personnel
- Fixed assets
- Economic units (establishments)


## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQL
- Tableau
- QGIS


## Functionalities of the Dashboards
- Visualize in a heat map the concentration of establishments.
- The heat map is designed to take into account both the number of establishments and the size (measured by employed personnel).
- Identify suppliers, customers and competition on another map where each selected activity takes a different color.
- Directory with information on the establishments of interest, with data on Company Name, Size, Telephone, Mail, Website and Address.
- Analyze the evolution of economic indicators by State.
- Identify the relative position of Jalisco in these indicators.
- Compare States in these indicators.
- You can customize a table with the values of these indicators to compare States of interest.
- You can customize a graph to see the progress of these indicators for States of interest.
- Filtering by economic activity is allowed for customized queries.
- The heat map and the location and directory map allow filtering by Cluster, Jalisco Region and Municipality for customized queries.
